# Economic-Trends-Data

Organizations and research institutes with an interest in economic trends in the United States should consider accessing the Bureau of Economic Analysis API, which provides programmatic access to published economic statistics, including national and regional GDP, income, subsidies, taxes, compensation of employees, and per capita GDP. The BEA API aggregates information from the Census to provide a statistical overview of the US economy and is a great tool for students in economics and organizations working to track trends in poverty and per capita GDP.
